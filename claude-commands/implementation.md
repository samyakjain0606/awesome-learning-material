Create goal-focused implementation phases. Each phase should deliver a working, testable milestone.

**Project:** _{Project name from your plan}_

**Tech Stack:** _{Brief summary from your plan}_

## üéØ PHASE-BASED IMPLEMENTATION

**Goal:** Break your project into phases where each phase delivers something that works and can be tested.

### Phase Template
For each phase, answer:
- **What works after this phase?** (testable milestone)
- **How do you test it?** (validation method)
- **What's the next logical step?** (next phase goal)

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: _[Core Foundation]_
**Goal:** _Get the most basic version working_

**Deliverable:** _What can you demo/test after this phase?_

**Tasks:**
- [ ] _Setup task 1_
- [ ] _Core feature 1_
- [ ] _Basic test_

**Success Test:** _How do you know this phase works?_

**Duration:** _X days/weeks_

---

### Phase 2: _[First Extension]_
**Goal:** _Add the next most important piece_

**Deliverable:** _What new capability does this unlock?_

**Tasks:**
- [ ] _Extension task 1_
- [ ] _Integration task_
- [ ] _Test the combination_

**Success Test:** _How do you validate the new functionality?_

**Duration:** _X days/weeks_

---

### Phase 3: _[Second Extension]_
**Goal:** _Build on what you have_

**Deliverable:** _What's the next working milestone?_

**Tasks:**
- [ ] _Enhancement task 1_
- [ ] _Polish task_
- [ ] _End-to-end test_

**Success Test:** _How do you verify it works end-to-end?_

**Duration:** _X days/weeks_

---

### Phase 4: _[Polish & Deploy]_
**Goal:** _Make it production-ready_

**Deliverable:** _Deployed, working system_

**Tasks:**
- [ ] _Deployment setup_
- [ ] _Performance testing_
- [ ] _Documentation_

**Success Test:** _Can others use it successfully?_

**Duration:** _X days/weeks_

---

## üß™ TESTING STRATEGY

**Phase 1:** _Simple manual test - does basic flow work?_
**Phase 2:** _Integration test - do parts work together?_
**Phase 3:** _Feature test - does extended functionality work?_
**Phase 4:** _User test - can real users accomplish their goals?_

## üìù PHASE TRACKING

- [ ] **Phase 1** - ‚è≥ Not Started
- [ ] **Phase 2** - ‚è≥ Not Started  
- [ ] **Phase 3** - ‚è≥ Not Started
- [ ] **Phase 4** - ‚è≥ Not Started

**Current Phase:** _Phase 1_
**Next Milestone:** _Date when Phase 1 should be complete_

## üí° EXAMPLE PHASES

**Research Agent Example:**
- Phase 1: Single query ‚Üí response (test: ask one question, get answer)
- Phase 2: Multi-step research (test: complex question requiring multiple searches)
- Phase 3: Source validation (test: verify sources are accurate)
- Phase 4: Report generation (test: create formatted research report)

**Web App Example:**
- Phase 1: User login + basic UI (test: user can sign up and see dashboard)
- Phase 2: Core feature working (test: main user workflow end-to-end)
- Phase 3: Data persistence (test: data survives page refresh)
- Phase 4: Production deployment (test: works for real users)

**E-commerce Site Example:**
- Phase 1: Product display (test: browse products, see details)
- Phase 2: Shopping cart (test: add items, modify quantities)
- Phase 3: Checkout process (test: complete purchase flow)
- Phase 4: Order management (test: track orders, handle returns)

**API Service Example:**
- Phase 1: Basic CRUD endpoints (test: create, read, update, delete records)
- Phase 2: Authentication (test: protected routes work with tokens)
- Phase 3: Business logic (test: complex operations work correctly)
- Phase 4: Production ready (test: handles load, has monitoring)

**Remember:** Each phase should give you something you can actually use and test. If you can't test it, the phase isn't complete.
